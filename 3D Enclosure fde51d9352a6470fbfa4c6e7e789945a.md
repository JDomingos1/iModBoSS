# 3D Enclosure

**Author:** *Pedro Ferreira*

## Fusion 360

The idea of the project is to make something modular that can be used by professors of various subjects, where each sensor module will have a box for itself and on the cover will be engraved the identification of each pin, the method of attachment will be a clip that will attach to a DIN rail.
**Primeiro protÃ³tipo:**
